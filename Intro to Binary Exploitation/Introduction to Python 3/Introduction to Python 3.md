## Keeping It Simple and Smart

### Defining Functions  
 
```python
wordlist = ['password', 'john', 'qwerty', 'admin']

for word in wordlist:
    counter = 0
    while counter < 100:
        print(f'{word}{counter}')
        counter = counter + 1
```      
        
*invation.py*
```python
# Defining the function
def print_sample_invitation(mother, father, child, teacher, event):

    # Notice here the use of a multi-line format-string: f''' text here '''
    sample_text = f'''
Dear {mother} and {father}.
{teacher} and I would love to see you both as well as {child} at our {event} tomorrow evening. 

Best regards,
Principal G. Sturgis.
'''
    # Print output
    print(sample_text)

# Call function
print_sample_invitation(mother='Karen', father='John', child='Noah', teacher='Tina', event='Pizza Party')
```
  
### Questions:  
    
Q: Write the function signature (def ...) for a function "foo" that has one argument "bar", including the trailing colon.  
A: `def foo(bar):`
  
Q: When we call a function and explicitly set the value of a parameter, e.g. foo(bar=42), this parameter is called a _____ parameter. (Fill the blank)  
A: `named`
  
Q: Functions which parameters are not named explicitly are called __________ parameters. (Fill the blank)  
A: `positional`
